I made the decision to learn more about TypeScript in order to hone my backend development abilities. To make sure the system is receiving the correct kind of data, the middleware I designed is essential to verifying the accuracy of the data types being communicated. It also manages user and file adjustments, taking care of the necessary changes to the file systems and user data. I decided to use TypeScript to hone my backend development abilities. The middleware I created is in charge of managing file and user modifications as well as verifying the accuracy of the sent data types. To simulate having a database, I created a JSON file and used it to hold all of the book data. I felt that this was the greatest option because I won't be keeping any complicated data, and the records won't grow to include more than a thousand items.
